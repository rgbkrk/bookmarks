### [Scalable C](https://www.gitbook.com/book/hintjens/scalable-c/details)

This book is still in progress, it's covered in gems though and will challenge how you think about open source contribution models. Read it for scalable C, stay for the community and contributions mantra.

### [Full Stack Redux React Webpack crazy pants tutorial](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html)

You have to devote time to working through this tutorial. It bothered me at first - why would they want immutable data structures? Isn't working in memory faster? That's just it though! If you have an immutable data structure that is a tree and you update a single node, the rest of the tree is the same as before. The reason this is important is that comparison of two trees is a matter of pointer comparison rather than deep value comparison.
